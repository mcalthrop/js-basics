# JavaScript data types <small>[[index]](README.md)</small>

It's helpful to know the building blocks of a language, so here we will be looking at the data types used in JavaScript.

There are six data types in JavaScript up to (and including) ES5:

1. [`Boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean) &ndash; for a variable that can only be either true or false
1. [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null) &ndash; represents the intentional absence of any object value
1. [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) &ndash; automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but not initialised, or to function parameters that have not been supplied
1. [`Number`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) &ndash; generic container for a number; unlike many other languages, there is no distinction between integers and floating point numbers
1. [`String`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) &ndash; to represent strings; there is no distinction between a single character and a string (a single character is a string that has a `length` of 1)
1. [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) &ndash; a simple object; note that the `{}` syntax is shorthand for instantiating a new `Object`

> **NOTE:** ES2015 introduces the [`Symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) primitive as well; here we are just sticking to ES5.
